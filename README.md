# Motivation for The LeetCode Journey

If you truly wanna get better at something, dedicate your time to it. I started attempting to solve leetcode problems cause of the urge to gauge myself against the set standards for employment. Surely it can't be that hard right? Guess again!
Like a frog that has always seen the sky from a well, I ventured into the world only to find out that there's much more to it.

I cannot express the gratitude I have towards these platforms. With varying levels of difficulty, one's mind is opened up to numerous ways of algorithmic thinking. I believe if one is familiar with the syntax of a specific language(just one), then you are all set to start solving leetcode problems. 
Realistically speaking its going to be difficult and you will struggle the first few times but once you get the hang of it, it starts getting easier and soon enough with the right consistency, your solving medium level (haven't reached) and hard problems.

Here's a guide I found ranked according to difficulty level that can also help you get started with your journey: https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/
